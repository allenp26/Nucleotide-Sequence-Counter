# Nucleotide-Sequence-Counter

design and build a program that will read in a text-based file representing a nucleotide sequence (of a yeast organism) and store all the possible subsequences of length k (i.e. k-mers) that are contained in the sequence along with a list of positions where the subsequence occurs. 
The position of the subsequence is defined as the index into the entire nucleotide sequence of the first character of the subsequence. The program will then allow the user to enter a nucleotide sequence of length k and will determine if the sequence exists in the original file and if so return its positions.
